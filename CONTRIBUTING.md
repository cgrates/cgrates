## Contributor Agreement (required for pull requests)

While the CGRateS project is open source under the GPLv3 license, contributions
back to this project which contain code must be made available to ITsysCOM GmbH under the terms of the MIT license.

### What does this mean?

This means ITsysCOM GmbH can do the following with code contributed
back to the project from the open source community.

1. Include the code in future CGRateS releases.
2. Include the code, in original or modified form, in other products created by ITsysCOM GmbH, **including closed-source products**.

### How do I agree to these terms?

To agree to these terms, sign the contributing agreement in `CONTRIBUTORS.md` and
include the change as a commit with your pull request. **Pull requests which contain
commits from users not explicitly listed in the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file will be
rejected *without review*.**

* You only need to sign the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file prior to the first time you
  submit a pull request (or include it as part of the pull request itself).
* The submitter of a pull request which adds a user to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file
  *must* match the user information which was added to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
  For example, only @danbogos can send a pull request containing a commit which adds
  @danbogos to the `CONTRIBUTORS.md` file.
