/*
This script will migrate CDRs from the old CGRateS tables to the new cdrs table
but it only migrate CDRs where the duration is > 0.
If you need CDRs also with duration is = 0 you can make the appropriate change in the line beginning WHERE cdrs_primary.usage

Also the script will process 10,000 CDRs before committing to save system resources 
especially in systems where they are millions of CDRs to be migrated
You can increase or lower the value of step in the line after BEGIN below.
