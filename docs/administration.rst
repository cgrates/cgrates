Administration
==============

The general steps to get CGRateS operational are:

#. Create CSV files containing the initial data for CGRateS.
#. Load the data in the databases using the Loader application.
#. Start the engine with the required components (depending on your setup).
#. Make API calls to the component you are interested or send events from your environment towards the :ref:`SessionS` via the :ref:`Agents<Agents>`.
