FreeSWITCH integration
======================

Being the original platform supported by CGRateS, FreeSWITCH_ has the advantage of support for complete set of CGRateS features.
When used as Telecom Switch it fully supports all rating modes: **prepaid**/**postpaid**/**pseudoprepaid**/**rated**.
A typical use case would be like the one in the diagram below:

The process of rating is decoupled into two different components:

SessionManager
--------------

**TODO** - update and add CDRs and CDRc.

- Attached to FreeSWITCH_ via the socket library, enhancing CGRateS with real-time call monitoring and call control functions.
- In Prepaid mode implements the following behaviour:
   - On *CHANNEL_PARK* event received from FreeSWITCH_: 
      - Authorize the call by calling *GetMaxSessionTime* on the Rater.
      - Sets the channel variable *cgr_notify* via *uuid_setvar* to one of the following values:
         - MISSING_PARAMETER: if one of the required channel variables is missing and CGRateS cannot make rating.
         - SYSTEM_ERROR: if rating could not be performed due to a system error.
         - INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS: if MaximSessionTime is 0.
         - AUTH_OK: Call is authorized to proceed. 
      - Un-Park the call via *uuid_transfer* to original dialed number. The FreeSWITCH_ administrator is expected to make use of *cgr_notify* variable value to either allow the call going further or reject it (eg: towards an IVR or returning authorization fail message to call originator).

   - On *CHANNEL_ANSWER* event received:
      - Index the call into CGRateS's cache.
      - Starts debit loop by calling at configured interval *MaxDebit* on the Rater.
      - If any of the debits fail:
          - Set *cgr_notify* channel variable to either SYSTEM_ERROR in case of errors or INSUFFICIENT_FUNDS of there would be not enough balance for the next debit to proceed.
          - Send *hangup* command with cause *MANAGER_REQUEST*.

    - On *CHANNEL_HANGUP_COMPLETE* event received:
       - Refund the reserved balance back to the user's account (works for both monetary and minutes debited).
       - Save call costs into CGRateS LogDB.

- In Postpaid mode:

   - On *CHANNEL_ANSWER* event received:
       - Index the call into CGRateS's cache.

   - On *CHANNEL_HANGUP_COMPLETE* event received:
       - Call *Debit* RPC method on the Rater.
       - Save call costs into CGRateS LogDB.

- On CGRateS Shutdown execute, for security reasons, hangup commands on calls which can be CGR related:
   - *hupall MANAGER_REQUEST cgr_reqtype prepaid*
   - *hupall MANAGER_REQUEST cgr_reqtype postpaid*
