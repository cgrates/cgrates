Data importing
==============

For importing the data into CGRateS database we are using cvs files. The import process can be started as many times it is desired with one ore more csv files and the existing values are overwritten. If the -flush option is used then the database is cleaned before importing.For more details see the cgr-loader tool from the tutorial chapter.

The rest of this section we will describe the content of every csv files.

Rates profile
--------------

The rates profile describes the prices to be applied for various calls to various destinations in various time frames. When a call is made the CGRateS system will locate the rates to be applied to the call using the rating profiles.

+------------+-----+-----------+-------------+----------------------+----------------+----------------------+
| Tenant     | ToR | Direction | Subject     | RatesFallbackSubject | RatesTimingTag | ActivationTime       |
+============+=====+===========+=============+======================+================+======================+

+------------+-----+-----------+-------------+----------------------+----------------+----------------------+

Tenant
    Used to distinguish between carriers if more than one share the same database in the CGRates system.
ToR
    Type of record specifies the kind of transmission this rate profile applies to.
Direction
    Can be IN or OUT for the INBOUND and OUTBOUND calls.
Subject
    The client/user for who this profile is detailing the rates.
RatesFallbackSubject
    This specifies another profile to be used in case the call destination will not be found in the current profile. The same tenant, tor and direction will be used.
RatesTimingTag
    Forwards to a tag described in the rates timing file to be used for this profile.
ActivationTime
    Multiple rates timings/prices can be created for one profile with different activation times. When a call is made the appropriate profile(s) will be used to rate the call. So future prices can be defined here and the activation time can be set as appropriate.

Rates timing
~~~~~~~~~~~~

This file makes links between a ratings and timings so each of them can be described once and various combinations are made possible.

+----------+----------------+--------------+--------+
| Tag      | RatesTag       | TimingTag    | Weight |
+==========+================+==============+========+
| STANDARD | RT_STANDARD    | WORKDAYS_00  | 10     |

| STANDARD | RT_STD_WEEKEND |  WORKDAYS_18 | 10     |
+----------+----------------+--------------+--------+

Tag
    A string by witch this rates timing will be referenced in other places by.
RatesTag
    The rating tag described in the rates file.
TimingTag

Weight
    If multiple timings cab be applied to a call the one with the lower weight wins. An example here can be the Christmas day: we can have a special timing for this day but the regular day of the week timing can also be applied to this day. The weight will differentiate between the two timings.

~~~~~~~~~~~~

The destinations are binding together various prefixes / caller ids to define a logical destination group. A prefix can appear in multiple destination groups.

Account actions
---------------

Describes the actions to be applied to the clients/users accounts. There are two kinds of actions: timed and triggered. For the timed actions there is a scheduler application that reads them from the database and executes them at the appropriate timings. The triggered actions are executed when the specified balance counters reach certain thresholds.

The accounts hold the various balances and counters to activate the triggered actions for each the client.

Balance types are: MONETARY, SMS, INTERNET, INTERNET_TIME, MINUTES.

+------------+---------+-----------+------------------+------------------+

ActionTimingsTag
    Forwards to a timed action group that will be used on this account.
ActionTriggersTag

Action triggers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~ 
For each account there are counters that record the activity on various balances. Action triggers allow when a counter reaches a threshold to activate a group of actions. After the execution the action trigger is marked as used and will no longer be evaluated until the triggers are reset. See actions for action trigger resetting.
