- [AgentS] Introduced \*routes_maxcost flag.
- [SessionS] max_call_duration config replaced with default_usage per ToR.
- [SessionS] If replication_conns are set, sessions will not terminate on shutdown.
- [EventCost] Improved FieldAsInterface function to prevent crashes when a RatingPlan doesn't exist (#2743).
- [EventCost] Added nil check when creating EventCost DataProvider, preventing crashes when cgr-engine is manually restarted during an ongoing call (#2764).
- [DispatcherS] Fixed panic when sending Ping request through DispatcherS.
- [CacheS] Tenant now passed to automatic cache calls (#2928).
- [DispatcherS] Added missing Responder methods to DispatcherS (#2954).
- [DispatcherS] The ArgDispatcher field for ThresholdS methods is now mandatory only if a connection to AttributeS has been defined (#2981).
- [DataManager] Revised caching logic for ActionPlans.
- [AttributeS] Introduced \*sipcid field type.
- [FilterS] New APIs for index status checks have been implemented.
- [SessionS] Tenant is set to default if not specified for SessionS APIs.
- [RALs] Fixed issue with \*any subject not considered when removing RatingProfiles (#3161).
- [ResourceS] ResourceS APIs updated for concurrent usage safety.
- [APIs] Addressed potential panic risk caused by API parameter validator function.
- [cgr-loader] Added tenant flag.
- [ApierS] Cache now reloaded when setting/removing RatingProfiles (#3186).
- [SessionS] Session synchronization no longer occurs with no active sessions.
- [RALs] Updated EventCost rounding increment handling (#3018).
- [SessionS] Protection added for missing events.
- [Config] Resolved issue with appending default port to multiple mongodb hosts in config file (#3673).
- [FSock] Fixed cgr-engine panic at startup when trying to connect to freeswitch_agent with logger set to \*stdout (#3678).
- [AttributeS/DispatcherS] Context/Subsystems now set to \*any if not specified.
- [FilterS] Added support for reverse filter indexes.
- [FSock] Addressed an issue where parsing responses from FreeSWITCH sometimes resulted in an unexpected number of values (#3749).
- [FSock] Resolved a connectivity issue where, if the connection between cgr-engine and the freeswitch agent was terminated during use, no reconnection attempts would be made (#3794).
- [Fsock] Corrected a parsing error where separators between parentheses were not ignored, leading to improper parsing of replies from the 'show channels' API call.
- [CDRe] Retained export_path as is for amqp, amqpv1, sqs, s3 and kafka exporters.
- [ServiceManager] Rectified a problem that prevented the RALs service from starting when the Responder was already running.
- [CDRs] Refund process now precedes debit during CDR rerating, fixing potential inaccuracies.
- [LoaderS] Introduced inline filter validation before DB write, preventing late-stage errors.
- [RPCClient] Updated to the latest version, addressing potential panic, deadlock, and data race issues.
- [CDRe] *exp.Cost path population no longer hardcoded to Cost found in *req map, user now can choose.
- [CDRe] Resolved an issue where the RoundingDecimals, if not explicitly set by the user, defaulted to 0 instead of the value defined under the "general" section in the configuration.
- [CDRe] Fixed a template problem where attempts to overwrite existing fields would lead to appending new values at the end of old ones, rather than replacing them.
- [CDRe] Overwriting preexisting fields in a template no longer appends new values at the end.
- [Storage] Introduced error handling for a previously overlooked case. Specifically, when GetCDRs is called for mongo with the remove flag set to true and the process returns an error, it previously led to a panic. This issue has now been addressed.
- [CDRe] Fixed support for \*combimed field type.
- [Docs] Updated installation documentation: https://cgrates.readthedocs.io/en/v0.10/installation.html.
- [CDRe] Added the possibility to override the exporter filter field through the API request signature.
- Updated all associated libraries to their most recent versions.
- Enhanced the testing suite and increased coverage.
- Fixes, updates and general quality of life changes that can be only noticed on the developer side so we will not be going into much detail:
  - updated ansible bash/ansible scripts;
  - improved formatting, readability;
  - reducing complexity of some functions.
- Implemented various fixes, updates, and enhancements primarily noticeable to developers (so we will not go into too much detail), including:

  - Enhanced code formatting and readability for better maintainability.
  - Simplified some complex functions to increase efficiency and ease of understanding.
  - Updated outdated Ansible and Bash scripts.
